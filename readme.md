## Introduction
This is a single page web app built with React.

- Flexible to any size of screen, including mobile phone.
- The data is cached so that it will NOT disappear when refreshing the page or closing the browser.
- Babel, Webpack, Yarn and SCSS are used in this project.

## Origin

Though I wrote all the code by my own, the idea of this is originally from the first project of [Udemy: The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/learn/v4/content).

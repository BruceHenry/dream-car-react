## Introduction
This web app is a demo of **React**. And it includes these features,
- Flexible to any size of screen, including mobile phone screen.
- The data is cached so that it will not be cleared when refreshing or closing the browser.
- Babel, Webpack, Yarn and SCSS are all used in this project.

## Origin

Though I wrote all the code by my own, the idea of this is originally from the first project of [Udemy: The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/learn/v4/content).
